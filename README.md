# Holy Grail Fullstack

## Description

The HolyGrail full stack project is a web layout built using modern web technologies. Named after the "Holy Grail" layout pattern, it presents a visually appealing and responsive design that consists of five distinct sections: header, left sidebar, main content area, right sidebar, and footer.

## Dependencies
(note: both React and Express are currently on port 3000)
- `npm install express` then `node index.js` to spin port 3000 up for the server

## Roadmap of Future Improvement

Add the backend to the project, improve the look of the classic Holy Grail layout with meaningful content.
